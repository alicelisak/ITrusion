You rally your men and press the assault forcefully, but the enemies overwhelm you and you're forced to pull back. As you try to organize the men, you turn and watch in horror as One-Eye charges towards you on his black steed and slams in his spear into your stomach, running you through. He smiles at you and orders his men to retreat, living to fight another day.\n\nAs the raiders leave, your men gather round you and you hear a woman scream. It's Dara, and she rushes to your side, cradling your head in her lap, tears spilling freely. She tells you how honored she is to be your wife and that she will raise your child to be as strong and brave as you. You've saved your tribe, for now, though you know not what will happen in the future. You can only hope that One-Eye and his raiders won't bother your people ever again. You die slowly."
